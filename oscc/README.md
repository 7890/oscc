```
oscc is built with Processing (processing.org)

prepare Processing with needed libraries:

copy from directory 'libs' the files 'oscP5-0.9.8.zip' and 'controlP5-2.0.4.1.zip' to '~/sketchbooks/libraries' and unzip there

load and run 'oscc.pde' in Processing

notes on exporting:

Processing version 2.0.1 is the last stable release that can export for any platform.
newer releases do only export applications for the platform Processing is started on.

see http://wiki.processing.org/w/Export_Info_and_Tips

after exporting, some minor changes are needed in order to make the Windows and OSX application.xx work nicely.

see 'create_dist.sh' for more information
